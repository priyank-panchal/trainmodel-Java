Section 2.  REGISTRATION.
            ------------

     (a) The  Company  shall,  within  fifteen  (15)  days  of the  date of this
Agreement,  file  with  the  SEC  the  Registration  Statement  or  Registration
Statements  (as is necessary) on Form S-1 (or, if such form is  unavailable  for

additional  shares of Common  Stock as may become  issuable  upon stock  splits,
stock dividends or similar  transactions.  The Company shall initially  register
for resale 30,000,000 shares of Common Stock which would be issuable on the date
preceding  the filing of the  Registration  Statement  based on the  closing bid
price of the  Company's  Common  Stock on such  date and the  amount  reasonably
calculated that  represents  Common Stock issuable to other parties as set forth
in the Investment Agreement except to the extent that the SEC requires the share
amount to be reduced as a condition of effectiveness.

     (b) The Company shall use all commercially  reasonable  efforts to have the
Registration  Statement(s)  declared  effective  by the SEC  within  sixty  (60)
calendar days after the Execution Date.

     (c)  The  Company  agrees  not  to  include  any  other  securities  in the
Registration  Statement  covering the Registrable  Securities without Investor's
prior  written  consent  which  Investor  may  withhold in its sole  discretion.
Furthermore,  the Company  agrees  that it will not file any other  Registration
Statement  for  other   securities,   until  thirty   calendar  days  after  the
Registration  Statement for the Registrable  Securities is declared effective by
the SEC.

Section 3.  RELATED OBLIGATIONS.
            -------------------

     At  such  time  as the  Company  is  obligated  to  prepare  and  file  the
Registration  Statement  with the SEC pursuant to Section 2(a), the Company will
effect the  registration  of the  Registrable  Securities in accordance with the
intended method of disposition  thereof and, with respect  thereto,  the Company
shall have the following obligations:

     (a) The Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
Registration   Statement  relating  to  the  Registrable  Securities  to  become
effective  within ninety (90) days after the Execution  Date and shall keep such
Registration Statement effective until the earlier to occur of the date on which
(A) the  Investor  shall have sold all the  Registrable  Securities;  or (B) the
Investor has no right to acquire any additional shares of Common Stock under the
Investment Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Period"). The
Registration  Statement  (including any  amendments or  supplements  thereto and
prospectuses  contained  therein)  shall not contain any untrue  statement  of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein, or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which
they  were  made,  not  misleading.  The  Company  shall  use  all  commercially
reasonable efforts to respond to all SEC comments within seven (7) business days
from  receipt  of such  comments  by the  Company.  The  Company  shall  use all
commercially  reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement relating to

                                       3
<PAGE>

the Registrable  Securities to become  effective no later than five (5) business
days after notice from the SEC that the  Registration  Statement may be declared
effective.  The Investor agrees to provide all information  which it is required
by law to provide to the Company,  including the intended  method of disposition
of the  Registrable  Securities,  and the Company's  obligations set forth above
shall be conditioned on the receipt of such information.

     (b) The  Company  shall  prepare  and file  with  the SEC  such  amendments
(including  post-effective  amendments)  and  supplements  to  the  Registration
Statement  and  the  prospectus  used  in  connection  with  such   Registration
Statement,  which  prospectus  is to be filed  pursuant to Rule 424  promulgated
under the 1933 Act,  as may be  necessary  to keep such  Registration  Statement
effective during the Registration  Period, and, during such period,  comply with
the  provisions  of  the  1933  Act  with  respect  to  the  disposition  of all
Registrable  Securities of the Company  covered by such  Registration  Statement
until such time as all of such  Registrable  Securities shall have been disposed
of in  accordance  with the  intended  methods of  disposition  by the  Investor
thereof as set forth in such Registration  Statement. In the event the number of
shares of Common Stock covered by the  Registration  Statement filed pursuant to
this  Agreement  is at any time  insufficient  to cover  all of the  Registrable
Securities,  the Company shall amend such Registration  Statement, or file a new
Registration Statement (on the short form available therefor, if applicable), or
both, so as to cover all of the Registrable Securities, in each case, as soon as
practicable,  but in any  event  within  thirty  (30)  calendar  days  after the
necessity  therefor arises (based on the then Purchase Price of the Common Stock
and other  relevant  factors on which the  Company  reasonably  elects to rely),
assuming the Company has  sufficient  authorized  shares at that time, and if it
does not, within thirty (30) calendar days after such shares are authorized. The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such amendment and/or
new Registration  Statement to become effective as soon as practicable following
the filing thereof.

     (c) The Company  shall make  available  to the Investor  whose  Registrable
Securities  are included in any  Registration  Statement  and its legal  counsel
without charge:

     (i)  promptly  after the same is  prepared  and filed with the SEC at least
          one (1)  copy  of such  Registration  Statement  and any  amendment(s)
          thereto,  including financial statements and schedules,  all documents
          incorporated  therein by reference  and all exhibits,  the  prospectus
          included in such  Registration  Statement  (including each preliminary
          prospectus) and, with regards to such Registration  Statement(s),  any
          correspondence  by or on behalf of the Company to the SEC or the staff
          of the SEC and any correspondence from the SEC or the staff of the SEC
          to the Company or its representatives;

     (ii) upon the  effectiveness  of any  Registration  Statement,  the Company
          shall make available copies of the prospectus,  via EDGAR, included in
          such  Registration   Statement  and  all  amendments  and  supplements
          thereto; and

     (iii) such other  documents,  including  copies of any preliminary or final
          prospectus,  as the Investor may reasonably  request from time to time
          in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities.

                                       4
<PAGE>

     (d) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to:

     (i)  register  and  qualify  the  Registrable  Securities  covered  by  the
          Registration  Statement under such other securities or "blue sky" laws
          of  such  states  in the  United  States  as the  Investor  reasonably
          requests;

     (ii) prepare and file in those  jurisdictions,  such amendments  (including
          post-effective  amendments) and supplements to such  registrations and
          qualifications  as may be  necessary  to  maintain  the  effectiveness
          thereof during the Registration Period;

     (iii) take  such  other  actions  as  may be  necessary  to  maintain  such
          registrations  and  qualifications  in effect at all times  during the
          Registration Period, and

     (iv) take all other  actions  reasonably  necessary or advisable to qualify
          the Registrable  Securities for sale in such jurisdictions;  provided,
          however,  that  the  Company  shall  not  be  required  in  connection
          therewith or as a condition thereto to:

          a.   qualify to do  business  in any  jurisdiction  where it would not
               otherwise be required to qualify but for this Section 3(d), or

          b.   subject itself to general taxation in any such jurisdiction.

The Company shall promptly notify the Investor who holds Registrable  Securities
of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension
of the registration or  qualification  of any of the Registrable  Securities for
sale under the securities or "blue sky" laws of any  jurisdiction  in the United
States or its receipt of actual notice of the  initiation or  threatening of any
proceeding for such purpose.

     (e) As promptly as  practicable  after  becoming  aware of such event,  the
Company  shall  notify  Investor in writing of the  happening  of any event as a
result of which the prospectus included in the Registration  Statement,  as then
in effect,  includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state
a  material  fact  required  to be  stated  therein  or  necessary  to make  the
statements  therein,  in light of the circumstances  under which they were made,
not misleading  (hereinafter referred to as "Registration  Default") and use all
diligent  efforts  to  promptly  prepare  a  supplement  or  amendment  to  such
Registration   Statement  and  take  any  other  necessary  steps  to  cure  the
Registration Default (which, if such Registration  Statement is on Form S-3, may
consist  of a  document  to be filed by the  Company  with the SEC  pursuant  to
Section 13(a),  13(c),  14 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act (as defined below) and to be
incorporated by reference in the prospectus) to correct such untrue statement or
omission,  and make  available  copies of such  supplement  or  amendment to the
Investor. The Company shall also promptly notify the Investor:

     (i)  When a  prospectus  or any  prospectus  supplement  or  post-effective
          amendment has been filed, and when the  Registration  Statement or any
          post-effective  amendment  has  become  effective  (the  Company  will

                                       5
<PAGE>

          prepare notification of such effectiveness which shall be delivered to
          the  Investor on the same day of such  effectiveness  and by overnight
          mail),  additionally,   the  Company  will  promptly  provide  to  the
          Investor,  a copy of the effectiveness  order prepared by the SEC once
          it is received by the Company;

     (ii) Of any  request  by the  SEC  for  amendments  or  supplements  to the
          Registration Statement or related prospectus or related information;

     (iii) Of the  Company's  reasonable  determination  that  a  post-effective
          amendment to the Registration Statement would be appropriate;

     (iv) In the event the Registration Statement is no longer effective;  and /
          or

     (v)  If the  Registration  Statement is stale as a result of the  Company's
          failure to timely file its financials or otherwise.

The  Company  acknowledges  that its  failure to cure the  Registration  Default
within ten (10)  business  days will cause the Investor to suffer  damages in an
amount that will be difficult to ascertain.  Accordingly, the parties agree that
it is  appropriate to include a provision for  liquidated  damages.  The parties
acknowledge  and agree that the liquidated  damages  provision set forth in this
section  represents the parties' good faith effort to quantify such damages and,
as such,  agree  that  the  form  and  amount  of such  liquidated  damages  are
reasonable and will not constitute a penalty. It is the intention of the parties
that interest  payable under any of the terms of this Agreement shall not exceed
the maximum amount  permitted  under any applicable law. If a law, which applies
to  this  Agreement,   which  sets  the  maximum  interest  amount,  is  finally
interpreted so that the interest in connection  with this Agreement  exceeds the
permitted  limits,  then:  (1) any such interest  shall be reduced by the amount
necessary  to reduce  the  interest  to the  permitted  limit;  and (2) any sums
already  collected (if any) from the Company  which exceed the permitted  limits
will be refunded to the Company.  The Investor may choose to make this refund by
reducing  the amount that the Company  owes under this  Agreement or by making a
direct  payment to the Company.  If a refund reduces the amount that the Company
owes the Investor, the reduction will be treated as a partial payment.

     (f) The Company shall use all  commercially  reasonable  efforts to prevent
the  issuance  of any stop order or other  suspension  of  effectiveness  of the
Registration  Statement,  or the suspension of the  qualification  of any of the
Registrable  Securities  for sale in any  jurisdiction  and, if such an order or
suspension  is issued,  to obtain the  withdrawal of such order or suspension at
the  earliest  possible  moment and to notify the Investor  holding  Registrable
Securities  being sold of the issuance of such order and the resolution  thereof
or its receipt of actual notice of the  initiation  or threat of any  proceeding
concerning the effectiveness of the registration statement.

     (g) The  Company  shall  permit  the  Investor  and one (1) legal  counsel,
designated  by the  Investor,  to  review  and  comment  upon  the  Registration
Statement and all amendments and  supplements  thereto at least one (1) calendar
day prior to their filing with the SEC. However, any postponement of a filing of

                                       6
<PAGE>

a Registration  Statement or any  postponement of a request for  acceleration or
any  postponement  of the  effective  date or  effectiveness  of a  Registration
Statement by written  request of the  Investor  (collectively,  the  "Investor's
Delay") shall not act to trigger any penalty of any kind, or any cash amount due
or any  in-kind  amount  due the  Investor  from the  Company  under any and all
agreements  of any nature or kind  between  the Company  and the  Investor.  The
event(s) of an Investor's Delay shall act to suspend all obligations of any kind
or nature of the  Company  under any and all  agreements  of any  nature or kind
between the Company and the Investor.

     (h) At the request of the Investor,  the Company's counsel shall furnish to
the Investor an opinion letter  confirming the effectiveness of the registration
statement.  Such  opinion  letter  shall  be  issued  as  of  the  date  of  the
effectiveness  of the  registration  statement  and be in a form suitable to the
Investor.

     (i) The Company  shall hold in  confidence  and not make any  disclosure of
information concerning the Investor unless:

     (i)  Disclosure of such  information is necessary to comply with federal or
          state securities laws;

     (ii) The disclosure of such  information is necessary to avoid or correct a
          misstatement or omission in any Registration Statement;

     (iii) The release of such  information is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or
          other final, non-appealable order from a court or governmental body of
          competent jurisdiction; or

     (iv) Such information has been made generally available to the public other
          than by  disclosure  in  violation  of  this  Agreement  or any  other
          agreement.

The  Company  agrees  that it  shall,  upon  learning  that  disclosure  of such
information  concerning the Investor is sought in or by a court or  governmental
body of  competent  jurisdiction  or through  other means,  give prompt  written
notice to the Investor and allow the Investor,  at the  Investor's  expense,  to
undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of, or to obtain a protective
order covering such information.

     (j) The Company shall use all commercially  reasonable  efforts to maintain
designation  and  quotation  of all the  Registrable  Securities  covered by any
Registration  Statement  on the  Principal  Market.  If,  despite the  Company's
commercially  reasonable efforts,  the Company is unsuccessful in satisfying the
preceding  sentence,  it shall use commercially  reasonable efforts to cause all
the Registrable Securities covered by any Registration Statement to be listed on
each other national  securities exchange and automated quotation system, if any,
on which  securities  of the same class or series issued by the Company are then
listed, if any, if the listing of such Registrable  Securities is then permitted
under the rules of such  exchange or system.  The Company shall pay all fees and
expenses in connection with satisfying its obligation under this Section 3(j).

                                       7
<PAGE>

     (k) The Company shall  cooperate with the Investor to facilitate the prompt
preparation and delivery of certificates representing the Registrable Securities
to  be  offered  pursuant  to  the   Registration   Statement  and  enable  such
certificates to be in such denominations or amounts,  as the case may be, as the
Investor  may  reasonably  request  (and  after  any  sales of such  Registrable
Securities  by the  Investor,  such  certificates  not bearing  any  restrictive
legend).

     (l) The  Company  shall  provide a transfer  agent for all the  Registrable
Securities not later than the effective date of the first Registration Statement
filed pursuant hereto.

     (m) If requested by the Investor, the Company shall:

     (i)  As soon as reasonably practical incorporate in a prospectus supplement
          or   post-effective   amendment  such   information  as  the  Investor
          reasonably  determines should be included therein relating to the sale
          and  distribution  of  Registrable  Securities,   including,   without
          limitation,   information   with   respect  to  the  offering  of  the
          Registrable Securities to be sold in such offering;

     (ii) Make  all  required   filings  of  such   prospectus   supplement   or
          post-effective  amendment as soon as reasonably  possible  after being
          notified  of  the  matters  to  be  incorporated  in  such  prospectus
          supplement or post-effective amendment; and

     (iii) Supplement  or  make  amendments  to any  Registration  Statement  if
          reasonably requested by the Investor.

     (n) The Company shall use all commercially  reasonable efforts to cause the
Registrable  Securities covered by the applicable  Registration  Statement to be
registered with or approved by such other  governmental  agencies or authorities
as  may  be  necessary  to  facilitate  the  disposition  of  such   Registrable
Securities.

     (o) The Company shall otherwise use all commercially  reasonable efforts to
comply with all applicable  rules and  regulations of the SEC in connection with
any registration hereunder.

     (p) Within one (1)  business  day after the  Registration  Statement  which
includes  Registrable  Securities is declared  effective by the SEC, the Company
shall deliver to the transfer agent for such Registrable Securities, with copies
to the Investor, confirmation that such Registration Statement has been declared
effective by the SEC.

     (q) The  Company  shall  take all other  reasonable  actions  necessary  to
expedite and facilitate  disposition  by the Investor of Registrable  Securities
pursuant to the Registration Statement.

          the Registration Statement or any post-effective  amendment thereto or
          in any  filing  made  in  connection  with  the  qualification  of the
          offering  under  the  securities  or  other  "blue  sky"  laws  of any
          jurisdiction  in which the Investor has  requested in writing that the
          Company  register  or qualify the Shares  (hereinafter  referred to as
          "Blue Sky  Filing"),  or the  omission or alleged  omission to state a
          material fact  required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the
          statements  therein,  in light of the  circumstances  under  which the
          statements therein were made, not misleading;

     (ii) Any untrue  statement or alleged  untrue  statement of a material fact
          contained in the final prospectus (as amended or supplemented,  if the
          Company  files any amendment  thereof or  supplement  thereto with the
          SEC) or the omission or alleged omission to state therein any material
          fact  necessary to make the statements  made therein,  in light of the
          circumstances  under  which the  statements  therein  were  made,  not
          misleading, or

     (iii) Any  violation  or alleged  violation by the Company of the 1933 Act,
          the 1934 Act, any other law, including,  without limitation, any state
          securities law, or any rule or regulation  thereunder  relating to the
          offer  or  sale  of  the  Registrable   Securities   pursuant  to  the
          Registration  Statement  (the  matters in the  foregoing  clauses  (i)
          through  (iii)  being,   collectively,   hereinafter  referred  to  as
          "Violations").

Subject  to the  restrictions  set  forth  in  Section  6(c) the  Company  shall
reimburse  the  Investor  and each such  controlling  person,  promptly  as such
expenses are incurred and are due and payable,  for any reasonable legal fees or
other reasonable  expenses incurred by them in connection with  investigating or
defending  any such Claim.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained
herein, the indemnification agreement contained in this Section 6(a):

     1)   Shall not apply to a Claim  arising  out of or based upon a  Violation
          which is due to the  inclusion  in the  Registration  Statement of the
          information  furnished  to  the  Company  by  any  Indemnified  Person
          expressly  for  use  in  connection   with  the   preparation  of  the

                                       10
<PAGE>

          Registration  Statement or any such  amendment  thereof or  supplement
          thereto;

     2)   Shall not be available to the extent such Claim is based on:

          a.   A failure of the  Investor to deliver or to cause to be delivered
               the prospectus made available by the Company; or

          b.   The Indemnified  Person's use of an incorrect  prospectus despite
               being  promptly  advised in advance by the Company in writing not
               to use such incorrect prospectus; or

          c.   Any  claims  based  on the  manner  of  sale  of the  Registrable
               Securities  by the  Investor  or of  the  Investor's  failure  to
               register as a dealer under applicable securities laws; or

          d.   Any  omission  of the  Investor  to  notify  the  Company  of any
               material fact that should be stated in the Registration Statement
               or prospectus relating to the Investor or the manner of sale; or

          e.   Any amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such settlement is
               effected without the prior written consent of the Company,  which
               consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  Such indemnity shall
               remain in full force and effect  regardless of any  investigation
               made by or on behalf of the Indemnified  Person and shall survive
               the resale of the Registrable Securities by the Investor pursuant
               to the Registration Statement.

     (b) In  connection  with any  Registration  Statement in which  Investor is
participating,  the Investor  agrees to severally  and jointly  indemnify,  hold
harmless  and defend,  to the same extent and in the same manner as is set forth
in Section 6(a), the Company,  each of its  directors,  each of its officers who
signs the Registration Statement,  each Person, if any, who controls the Company
within  the  meaning  of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act and the  Company's  agents
(collectively and together with an Indemnified Person,  hereinafter  referred to
as an "Indemnified  Party"),  against any Claim or Indemnified  Damages to which
any of them may become  subject,  under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise,
insofar as such Claim or Indemnified  Damages arise out of or are based upon any
Violation,  in each  case to the  extent,  and  only to the  extent,  that  such

                                       11
<PAGE>

Violation is due to the inclusion in the  Registration  Statement of the written
information  furnished  to the  Company  by the  Investor  expressly  for use in
connection with such Registration  Statement;  and, subject to Section 6(c), the
Investor will reimburse any legal or other expenses  reasonably incurred by them
in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim; provided, however,
that the  indemnity  agreement  contained in this Section 6(b) and the agreement
with respect to  contribution  contained in Section 7 shall not apply to amounts
paid in settlement of any Claim if such settlement is effected without the prior
written  consent  of the  Investor,  which  consent  shall  not be  unreasonably
withheld;  provided,  further,  however,  that the Investor shall only be liable
under this  Section  6(b) for that amount of a Claim or  Indemnified  Damages as
does not exceed the net  proceeds  to such  Investor  as a result of the sale of
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration  Statement.  Such indemnity
shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or
on  behalf  of such  Indemnified  Party  and  shall  survive  the  resale of the
Registrable  Securities by the Investor pursuant to the Registration  Statement.
Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained herein, the  indemnification
agreement  contained  in this  Section  6(b)  with  respect  to any  preliminary
prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Indemnified Party if the untrue
statement or omission of material fact contained in the  preliminary  prospectus
were  corrected  on a  timely  basis  in the  prospectus,  as  then  amended  or
supplemented.  This  indemnification  provision  shall apply  separately to each
Investor and liability hereunder shall not be joint and several.

     (c) Promptly  after receipt by an Indemnified  Person or Indemnified  Party
under this Section 6 of notice of the  commencement  of any action or proceeding
(including  any  governmental  action or  proceeding)  involving  a Claim,  such
Indemnified  Person or Indemnified Party shall, if a Claim in respect thereof is
to be made against any  indemnifying  party under this Section 6, deliver to the
indemnifying  party  a  written  notice  of the  commencement  thereof,  and the
indemnifying  party shall have the right to  participate  in, and, to the extent
the indemnifying  party so desires,  jointly with any other  indemnifying  party
similarly  noticed,  to assume  control  of the  defense  thereof  with  counsel
mutually  satisfactory to the indemnifying  party and the Indemnified  Person or
the  Indemnified  Party,  as  the  case  may  be;  provided,  however,  that  an
Indemnified  Person or Indemnified  Party shall have the right to retain its own
counsel with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying  party, if, in
the  reasonable  opinion  of  counsel  retained  by the  Indemnified  Person  or
Indemnified  Party, the  representation by counsel of the Indemnified  Person or
Indemnified  Party and the  indemnifying  party  would be  inappropriate  due to
actual or  potential  differing  interests  between such  Indemnified  Person or
Indemnified  Party and any  other  party  represented  by such  counsel  in such
proceeding.  The  indemnifying  party shall pay for only one (1) separate  legal
counsel for the Indemnified  Persons or the Indemnified  Parties, as applicable,
and such counsel shall be selected by the Investor,  if the Investor is entitled
to  indemnification  hereunder,  or the  Company,  if the Company is entitled to
indemnification  hereunder, as applicable.  The Indemnified Party or Indemnified
Person shall cooperate fully with the indemnifying  party in connection with any
negotiation or defense of any such action or Claim by the indemnifying party and
shall furnish to the indemnifying party all information  reasonably available to
the  Indemnified  Party or  Indemnified  Person which  relates to such action or
Claim.  The indemnifying  party shall keep the Indemnified  Party or Indemnified
Person  fully  apprised  at all  times as to the  status of the  defense  or any
settlement  negotiations  with respect thereto.  No indemnifying  party shall be
liable for any settlement of any action,  claim or proceeding  affected  without
its written consent,  provided,  however,  that the indemnifying party shall not
unreasonably  withhold,  delay or condition its consent.  No indemnifying  party
shall,  without  the consent of the  Indemnified  Party or  Indemnified  Person,
consent  to  entry  of any  judgment  or  enter  into  any  settlement  or other
compromise which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified  Party or Indemnified  Person of a
release from all liability in respect to such Claim.  Following  indemnification
as provided for  hereunder,  the  indemnifying  party shall be subrogated to all
rights of the Indemnified Party or Indemnified  Person with respect to all third
parties,  firms or corporations relating to the matter for which indemnification
has been made. The failure to deliver written notice to the  indemnifying  party
within a  reasonable  time of the  commencement  of any such  action  shall  not

                                       12
<PAGE>

relieve such  indemnifying  party of any liability to the Indemnified  Person or
Indemnified  Party  under  this  Section  6,  except  to  the  extent  that  the
indemnifying party is prejudiced in its ability to defend such action.

      (d) The indemnity agreements contained herein shall be in addition to (i)
any cause of action or similar right of the Indemnified Party or Indemnified
Person against the indemnifying party or others, and (ii) any liabilities the
indemnifying party may be subject to pursuant to the law.


Section 7.  CONTRIBUTION.
            ------------

     To the extent any indemnification by an indemnifying party is prohibited or
limited by law, the indemnifying  party agrees to make the maximum  contribution
with respect to any amounts for which it would otherwise be liable under Section
6 to the fullest  extent  permitted  by law;  provided,  however,  that:  (i) no
contribution  shall be made under  circumstances  where the maker would not have
been liable for  indemnification  under the fault standards set forth in Section
6;  (ii)  no   seller   of   Registrable   Securities   guilty   of   fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be
entitled to contribution  from any seller of Registrable  Securities who was not
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation;  and (iii) contribution by any seller of
Registrable  Securities shall be limited in amount to the net amount of proceeds
received by such seller from the sale of such Registrable Securities.


Section 8.  REPORTS UNDER THE 1934 ACT.
            --------------------------

     With a view to making  available  to the  Investor the benefits of Rule 144
promulgated  under the 1933 Act or any other  similar rule or  regulation of the
SEC that may at any time permit the Investor to sell  securities  of the Company
to the public  without  registration  ("Rule  144"),  provided that the Investor
holds any Registrable Securities are eligible for resale under Rule 144 (k), the
Company agrees to:

     (a)  Make  and keep  public  information  available,  as  those  terms  are
          understood and defined in Rule 144; and

     (b)  File with the SEC in a timely  manner all reports and other  documents
          required of the Company under the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act so long as
          the Company remains subject to such  requirements (it being understood
          that  nothing  herein  shall  limit the  Company's  obligations  under
          Section  5(c) of the  Investment  Agreement)  and the  filing  of such
          reports and other documents is required for the applicable  provisions
          of Rule 144; and

     (c)  Furnish to the Investor, promptly upon request:

          a.   A written  statement by the Company that it has complied with the
               reporting  requirements  of Rule  144,  the 1933 Act and the 1934
               Act,

                                       13
<PAGE>

          b.   A copy of the most  recent  annual  or  quarterly  report  of the
               Company  and such other  reports  and  documents  so filed by the
               Company,  and (iii) such other  information  as may be reasonably
               requested to permit the Investor to sell such securities pursuant
               to Rule 144 without registration.


Section 9.  NO ASSIGNMENT OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS.
            ------------------------------------

     The rights and obligations under this Agreement shall not be assignable.


Section 10.  AMENDMENT OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS.
             --------------------------------

     The  provisions  of this  Agreement  may be amended  only with the  written
consent of the Company and Investor.


Section 11.  MISCELLANEOUS.
             -------------

     (a) Any notices or other  communications  required or permitted to be given
under the terms of this Agreement that must be in writing will be deemed to have
been delivered (i) upon receipt, when delivered  personally;  (ii) upon receipt,
when sent by facsimile  (provided a confirmation of transmission is mechanically
or electronically generated and kept on file by the sending party); or (iii) one
(1) day after deposit with a nationally  recognized  overnight delivery service,
in each case properly  addressed to the party to receive the same. The addresses
and facsimile numbers for such communications shall be:

If to the Company:

      TransBioTec, Inc.
      3030 Old Ranch Parkway
      Suite 350
      Seal Beach, CA 90740

If to the Investor:

      Kodiak Capital Group, LLC
      260 Newport Center Drive
      Suite 100
      Newport Beach, CA 92660

     Each party shall  provide five (5) business  days prior notice to the other
party of any change in address, phone number or facsimile number.

                                       14
<PAGE>

     (b)  Failure  of any  party to  exercise  any right or  remedy  under  this
Agreement or otherwise,  or delay by a party in exercising such right or remedy,
shall not operate as a waiver thereof.

     (c) This  Agreement and the  Transaction  Documents  constitute  the entire
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof. There are no restrictions,  promises, warranties or undertakings, other
than those set forth or referred to herein and therein.

     (d) This  Agreement  and the  Transaction  Documents  supersede  all  prior
agreements  and  understandings  among the parties  hereto  with  respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof.

     (e) The headings in this  Agreement are for  convenience  of reference only
and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof. Whenever required by
the  context  of this  Agreement,  the  singular  shall  include  the plural and
masculine  shall include the feminine.  This Agreement shall not be construed as
if it had been prepared by one of the parties,  but rather as if all the parties
had prepared the same.

     (f) This Agreement may be executed in two or more  identical  counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which shall  constitute one
and the same  agreement.  This  Agreement,  once  executed  by a  party,  may be
delivered to the other party hereto by facsimile  transmission of a copy of this
Agreement bearing the signature of the party so delivering this Agreement.

     (g) Each party shall do and perform, or cause to be done and performed, all
such  further  acts and  things,  and shall  execute  and deliver all such other
agreements,  certificates,  instruments  and  documents,  as the other party may
reasonably  request in order to carry out the intent and accomplish the purposes
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

     (h) In case any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction  to be excessive in scope or  otherwise  invalid or  unenforceable,
such provision shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible,  so that it is
enforceable to the maximum extent possible,  and the validity and enforceability
of the remaining provisions of this Agreement will not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby. The normal rule of construction and contractual interpretation
that  ambiguities  should be held  against the drafting  party is not  operative
under this agreement.


Section 12.  DISPUTES SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION GOVERNED BY NEW YORK LAW
             --------------------------------------------------------

     All  disputes  arising  under  this  agreement  shall  be  governed  by and
interpreted in accordance  with the laws of the State of New York without regard
to principles of conflict of laws. The parties to this agreement will submit all
disputes  arising under this agreement to arbitration in New York City, State of
New York before a single  arbitrator  of the  American  Arbitration  Association
("AAA").  The  arbitrator  shall be selected by  application of the rules of the
AAA, or by mutual agreement of the parties, except that such arbitrator shall be

                                       15
<PAGE>

an attorney  admitted to practice  law in New York,  New York.  No party to this
agreement will  challenge the  jurisdiction  or venue  provisions as provided in
this section. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the party from obtaining an
order to compel  arbitration  under NY CPLR Article 75. Nothing contained herein
shall prevent the party from obtaining injunctive relief.
